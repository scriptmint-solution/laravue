## Idea

I have developed a comprehensive UI using Laravel 11, Vue.js 3, and Tailwind CSS 3, which is currently implemented in my existing project. You can explore the UI at [https://ui.scriptmint.com](https://ui.scriptmint.com).

Now, I aim to refactor the code to make it more modular, reusable, and developer-friendly. This initiative can also serve as a valuable resource for other developers.

In parallel, I plan to learn **Nuxt.js** (to build SEO friendly websites and applications) and **Next.js** (to be part of biggest developer community). My approach is to first build an advanced starter kit with Vue.js and then extend it by consuming the same API in Nuxt.js and Next.js, showcasing the flexibility of the API-driven architecture.

Additionally, I intend to leverage this API to develop a mobile app using **React Native**, building on my experience with the existing UI kit for mobile applications.

### 2025 Goals:
1. Release the **starter kit** with Vue.js.
2. Extend the project by integrating **Nuxt.js** and **Next.js**.
3. Develop a **React Native app** using the same API.

By documenting this process, I aim to stay organized, track my progress, and remain accountable. If this project benefits others in the developer community, that would be an added bonus.
